    ## 📈 Deterministic Forecast
    
    > **Predicted Outcome:**
    > **Eagles win by 10–14 points**
    > Deterministic model flags Dallas as entering the season with unresolved system stress, while Philly appears emotionally stable and tactically prepped. Expect a run-game confidence build, early defensive pressure, and coaching control to lock tempo.

    ## 🔄 Entropy Drift Factors
    
    - **Cowboys Narrative Load**: 2+ off-season documentaries, podcast volatility → drift risk ↑
    - **Eagles Vibe Lock**: Gatorade unity, coach-emotion sync, clean press week → drift risk ↓
    - **Wildcard**: If Cowboys special teams open strong, game balance may shift temporarily.
