### 🦅 Philadelphia Eagles

| Signal             | Status             |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Team Cohesion      | ✅ Stable Core     |
| Coaching Sync      | 🔥 Locked-In       |
| QB Drift Risk      | ⚠️ Low–Moderate    |
| Emotional Signal   | ✅ Phase Aligned   |
| Practice Vibe      | 🔒 High Intensity  |

**Logic-Safe Verdict:**  
> Entering 2025 as the most logic-safe team in the NFC East. Trench-aligned, emotionally stable, and strategically cohesive. Only weakness: depth rotations in the secondary during fatigue weeks.

📈 **Win Range:** 11–13  
📉 **Collapse Risk:** Minimal

### ⭐ Dallas Cowboys

| Signal             | Status                |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Team Cohesion      | ⚠️ Shaky              |
| Coaching Sync      | ❌ Volatile           |
| QB Drift Risk      | 🔥 High (Phase Risk)  |
| Emotional Signal   | ❌ Split Signals      |
| Practice Vibe      | 🚫 Soft Lock          |

**Logic-Safe Verdict:**  
> Classic “drift path” team. If they hit emotional sync, they could win the division. But internal volatility and coaching tension create wide variance.

📈 **Win Range:** 8–12  
📉 **Collapse Risk:** High

### 🗽 New York Giants

| Signal             | Status                |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Team Cohesion      | ✅ Improving          |
| Coaching Sync      | 🔄 Mid-Calibrated     |
| QB Drift Risk      | ⚠️ Inconsistent      |
| Emotional Signal   | 😐 Plateaued          |
| Practice Vibe      | ✅ Quiet Intensity    |

**Logic-Safe Verdict:**  
> Hovering in the middle. The ceiling exists if QB play levels up, but no high-variance signals here. Moderate upside, moderate floor.

📈 **Win Range:** 6–9  
📉 **Collapse Risk:** Medium

### 🪖 Washington Commanders

| Signal             | Status                |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Team Cohesion      | ❌ In Flux           |
| Coaching Sync      | 🔄 Installing System |
| QB Drift Risk      | 🧪 Rookie Variability |
| Emotional Signal   | 🤔 Rebuilding Energy |
| Practice Vibe      | 🧱 Workmanlike        |

**Logic-Safe Verdict:**  
> This is a rebuild year. Roster not yet in alignment, QB too early in arc, and coaching still being installed. Emotionally steady, but structurally raw.

📈 **Win Range:** 4–7  
📉 **Collapse Risk:** Already priced in
