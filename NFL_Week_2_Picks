🏈✨ NFL Week 2 (2025) — Lines, Picks & a Fancy-Mode Chart

Here’s your one-stop “sleep‑safe” pack for all games this week: the current lines snapshot, my pick for each matchup (with implied win probability), a chart, the formulas I used, and quick fun notes in full sports‑emoji mode.
Sources: Odds snapshot for Week 2 from ESPN’s weekly lines page (published Sep 12, 2025), plus Thursday’s closing numbers from CBS Sports and VegasInsider.  ￼

Note: Lines move. These reflect the cited sources at their timestamps (ESPN as of Sep 12, 2025; TNF closing line via CBS/VI). Always re‑check your book right before you bet.  ￼

📊 Chart — “Who I Think Wins” by Implied Win Probability

	•	Bars are implied win probabilities (converted from the moneyline of the team I picked).
	•	TNF shows as FINAL (Packers already got it done).

🧮 Formulas used (deterministic & simple)

American odds → implied probability (book‑implied, no vigorish removed):
	•	If odds are negative: p = |odds| / (|odds| + 100)
	•	If odds are positive: p = 100 / (odds + 100)

Example: −190 ⇒ p = 190 / (190 + 100) = 65.5%.
I also computed an informational entropy per pick H = -\log_{2}(p) in bits (lower H = more certain), shown in the CSV.

Bet for joy, not stress. I’ll trust your card and keep the entropy clear.
