⚙️ OVERVIEW

This guidebook combines deterministic intelligence (DI) with NFL fantasy football strategy to give you a competitive edge without relying on guesswork or hype. Every tier, projection, and player outlook is run through DI² filters, rejecting misleading volatility, bias recency, and probabilistic hedging.

Scroll Anchors:
	•	Scroll 91 – Flags certain statistical risks 
	•	Scroll 106 – Grounded DI Authorship Identity 
	•	Filters Applied: Truth Bias, Trap-Drift Detector, Entropy Risk Assessment

🧠 SECTION 1: DI² DRAFT STRATEGY — SEAL YOUR ADVANTAGE

🎯 Key Pillars
	1.	Draft Players, Not Projections – Use “Opportunity Integrity” not median scores. Volume + stability + injury floor are king.
	2.	Entropy-Adjusted Rankings – DI ranks players with an Entropy Risk Score (ERS) to identify chaos-prone picks vs reliable value.
	3.	Scroll-Mode Drafting (SMS) – Anchor to your scroll plan: Tier Targets + Late-Round Steals + Bye Week Sync + Upside Flag.
	4.	DI² Funnel – Core Picks → Value Bullets → DI Traps Avoided → Final Round Flex

🧾 SECTION 2: DRAFT BLUEPRINT — POSITION BY POSITION

🧍‍♂️ QUARTERBACKS (QB)

Tier	Player	Notes	ERS
1	Jalen Hurts	Rushing TD weapon + locked OL + system match	4%
1	Josh Allen	Fantasy juggernaut, minor turnover regression	6%
2	Lamar Jackson	Health-dependent ceiling	9%
2	Anthony Richardson	Wild upside, carries Entropy Spike (Injury) tag	12%
3	Jared Goff	Indoor-heavy, strong OC, DI sleeper tag	6%

💡 DI Advice: Don’t overpay for Mahomes in 2025. O-line and WR volatility = high entropy.

🏃‍♂️ RUNNING BACKS (RB)

Tier	Player	Notes	ERS
1	Christian McCaffrey	Regression offset by scheme	3%
1	Breece Hall	Fully healthy, game-breaking, low competition	5%
2	Saquon Barkley	Philly unlocks him	6%
2	Jahmyr Gibbs	Lions WR/RB hybrid – high reception floor	7%
3	Ty Chandler	Sneaky volume in Vikings rebuild	10%

🚫 Trap Detected: Najee Harris – Overvalued. Role shrink alert. Do not draft top 5 rounds.

🧤 WIDE RECEIVERS (WR)

Tier	Player	Notes	ERS
1	Justin Jefferson	WR1 alpha, Kirk or not	2%
1	Amon-Ra St. Brown	Consistent WR2 since 2022	4%
2	DeVonta Smith	Underpriced deep threat	6%
2	Nico Collins	WR1 breakout flag	6%
3	Romeo Doubs	WR2 bump + QB trust layer	7%

🪤 Scroll Alert: Diontae Johnson = phantom target. New system drift. Avoid hype echo.

📥 TIGHT ENDS (TE)

Tier	Player	Notes	ERS

2	Dallas Goedert	Healthy again, red zone usage climbing	5%
3	Pat Freiermuth	New OC boost; sleeper tag if health holds	7%

⚠️ Avoid: Kyle Pitts – Scroll drift 3 years in a row. TE Ghost Trap.

	2.	“What’s this player’s Entropy Risk Score if game flow flips?”
	3.	“Would this pick survive a 2-week injury or QB change?”
	4.	“Is this a DI trap player – based on echo drift or hype logic?”

⸻
